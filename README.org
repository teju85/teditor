* teditor
While all editors support terminal capabilities, how about we try to have a
terminal support editor capabilities!? *teditor* is a terminal based editor,
written in C++, to explore this aspect. Teditor is inspired from [[https://github.com/tomas/eon][eon]].
* Pre-reqs
Very minimal set of pre-reqs are needed for this project!
1. GNU-make (>=4.2.1)
2. G++ (>= 5.4.0)
3. mintty (for running the editor)
4. doxygen (>=1.8.13) (for documentation generation)
5. curl (for downloading from web)
* Download and Installation
Currently, only been tested on cygwin with xterm-256.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/teju85/teditor
$ cd teditor
$ make -j teditor
$ ./teditor
#+END_SRC
NOTE: If you have customized your minttyrc for the user configured colors,
then your experience with the default colors may vary!!
