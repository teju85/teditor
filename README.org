* teditor
While all editors support terminal capabilities, how about we try to have a
terminal support editor capabilities!? *teditor* is a terminal based editor,
written in C++, to explore this aspect. Teditor is inspired from [[https://github.com/tomas/eon][eon]]. Besides,
writing an editor from scratch is a real fun way to get to know a lot about
programming, OS and terminal concepts!
* Pre-reqs
Very minimal set of pre-reqs are needed for this project!
1. GNU-make (>=4.2.1)
2. G++ (>= 5.4.0)
3. mintty (for running the editor)
4. doxygen (>=1.8.13) (for documentation generation)
5. curl (for downloading from web, from inside the editor)
* Download and Build
Currently, only been tested on cygwin with xterm-256.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/teju85/teditor
$ cd teditor
$ make -j teditor
$ ./teditor
#+END_SRC
NOTE: If you have customized your minttyrc for the user configured colors,
then your experience with the default colors may vary!!
* Generating documentation
It is expected that one has installed doxygen for this purpose. Generated
documentation can then be found inside the folder 'html'.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ make doc
#+END_SRC
* Developers
** Unit testing
Unit-tests are run via googletest.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ make -j gtests
#+END_SRC
** googletest
