Changes/features in this release:
1. Command for DNS lookup: `M-x dns`.
2. In-built calculator: `M-x calc`.
3. Command to open files using another programs while in dir-mode. Just hit `s`
   while putting point on that file.
4. Show the hits nearby the current point location itself during `search`.
5. Removed pcre2 and catch2 as submodules (helps reduce repo size). From now
   onwards, `parser::NFA` will be used for regex's instead of pcre2.
6. Option for debug and release builds in the build infra.
7. Ability to filter irrelevent commands in any mode.
8. A `History` base class for storing historical commands, files visited, etc
9. ledger-mode now has a stronger parser based on Lexing!
10. A `LRUCache` class
