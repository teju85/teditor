Date: 2019-11-18

Glad to announce the release of the next version of teditor: v1.4.0. It
can be found [here](https://github.com/teju85/teditor/releases/tag/1.4.0).

@section releases_140_changes Changes
Changes/features in this release:
1. Complete removal of multiple-cursors from the editor. (reason below)
2. Bug fixes to highlighting the empty lines under selection.

@section releases_140_no_mc Why no Multiple Cursors?
There are multiple reasons for this:
1. We'll introduce more macro-like interface that'll void the need for such a
   thing. Many blogs have been written about this [here](https://medium.com/@schtoeffel/you-don-t-need-more-than-one-cursor-in-vim-2c44117d51db)
   and [here](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/09/07/). Thus I do not want to
   elaborate further on this.
2. In future, underlying implementation of buffers can be optimized very easily
   without multiple-cursors support [Reference](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/09/07/)
