@section releases_160_grep grep mode
This is similar to the grep mode in emacs. `M-x grep <enter>` type the regex
to search for and the file/dir where to search and then press enter. This should
open a buffer with all grep results highlighted. From then onwards, pressing
enter on each result of grep will take you to that file and line (similar to
what happens in grep mode of emacs).
