Date: 2019-08-11

Glad to announce the release of the next version of teditor: v1.3.0. It
can be found [here](https://github.com/teju85/teditor/releases/tag/1.3.0).

@section releases_130_changes Changes
Changes/features in this release:
1. Adds support for ledger-like text file based syntax for personal finanace
   accounting.
2. Reintroduces proper kill-line command based on the new undo/redo stack.
3. More unittests improve coverage
4. Bug fixes to the undo/redo for insert-char command.

### Ledger Mode
To start using this for tracking your personal finances:
1. Create a file named `ledger.lg` inside your `~/.teditor` folder. (one can
   also create such a file elsewhere and then use the `-ledger-file` option)
2. Refer to the file `samples/ledger/sample.lg` to know its syntax. It is very
   simplified version of the [ledger-cli](https://www.ledger-cli.org/) syntax.
3. Once you have this file populated with information, get back to the teditor
   window and press `C-l C-d` in order to see the summary of your transactions.
4. By default, it shows a summary report of all transactions grouped under the
   top-level accounts. Press `A` to show them for all accounts.
